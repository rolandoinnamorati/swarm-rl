\section{Introduction}
    Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are increasingly recognized as a transformative asset in modern warfare, offering scalability, redundancy, and robustness in adversarial scenarios. When coordinated effectively, drone swarms can perform tasks ranging from area denial to reconnaissance and targeted elimination, often outperforming single-agent systems in dynamic and communication-denied environments. However, traditional approaches to multi-agent coordination typically rely on centralized planning, high-bandwidth communication, or full-state awareness, which become unreliable under electronic warfare conditions and do not scale efficiently with swarm size.
